## Introduction
ScriptSaga is a comprehensive educational platform designed to facilitate coding education and practice. The platform integrates various features for different user roles, including students, teachers, and administrators.

## System Architecture
The project follows a client-server architecture with:
- Frontend: React-based web application
- Backend: Node.js/Express.js REST API
- Database: MongoDB for data persistence

## User Roles

### 1. Admin
Administrators have the highest level of access and control over the platform.

### 2. Teacher
Teachers are responsible for managing classes, assignments, and student progress.

### 3. Student
Students are the primary users who learn and practice coding through the platform.
