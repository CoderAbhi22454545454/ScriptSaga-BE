# Student Metrics System Documentation

## Overview
The Student Metrics System is a comprehensive analytics tool that evaluates a student's programming skills and progress across various domains. It combines data from GitHub repositories and LeetCode profiles to provide detailed insights into a student's development journey.

## Components

### 1. Skill Assessment

#### Frontend Development Score
- **Calculation Method**: Weighted scoring based on multiple metrics
- **Metrics Considered**:
  - Number of commits in frontend technologies (JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS)
  - Number of repositories using frontend technologies
  - Activity level in frontend projects
- **Weight Distribution**:
  - Commits: 20%
  - Active Days: 20%
  - Repository Count: 5%
  - Star Count: 5%

#### Backend Development Score
- **Calculation Method**: Similar weighted scoring system
- **Metrics Considered**:
  - Number of commits in backend technologies (Python, Java, Go, PHP)
  - Number of repositories using backend technologies
  - Activity level in backend projects
- **Weight Distribution**:
  - Commits: 20%
  - Active Days: 20%
  - Repository Count: 5%
  - Star Count: 5%

#### Problem Solving Score
- **Calculation Method**: Based on LeetCode performance
- **Metrics Considered**:
  - Total problems solved
  - Problem difficulty distribution
  - Consistency in solving problems
- **Weight Distribution**:
  - Total Problems Solved: 30%
  - Problem Difficulty: 20%

### 2. Activity Level Assessment

#### Activity Categories
1. **Very Active**
   - 25+ days of activity
   - High commit frequency
   - Regular problem solving

2. **Active**
   - 15-24 days of activity
   - Moderate commit frequency
   - Regular problem solving

3. **Moderate**
   - 5-14 days of activity
   - Occasional commits
   - Intermittent problem solving

4. **Inactive**
   - Less than 5 days of activity
   - Few commits
   - Limited problem solving

### 3. Domain Recommendations

#### Language Analysis
- Analyzes programming languages used across repositories
- Calculates language distribution
- Identifies primary and secondary languages

#### Domain Mapping
- Maps languages to career domains
- Considers language combinations
- Provides domain-specific recommendations

### 4. Learning Path Recommendations

#### Path Generation
- Based on current skill levels
- Aligned with domain recommendations
- Customized to student's progress

#### Priority Levels
1. **High Priority**
   - Core skills needing improvement
   - Essential for chosen domain
   - Critical gaps in knowledge

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Supplementary skills
   - Domain-specific enhancements
   - Advanced concepts

## Technical Implementation

### Skill Level Calculation
```javascript
const calculateSkillLevel = (metrics) => {
  const {
    commits,
    activeDays,
    problemSolved,
    problemDifficulty,
    repoCount,
    starCount
  } = metrics;

  // Weighted scoring system
  const commitScore = Math.min(commits / 200, 1) * 0.2;
  const activityScore = Math.min(activeDays / 30, 1) * 0.2;
  const problemScore = Math.min(problemSolved / 100, 1) * 0.3;
  const difficultyScore = Math.min(problemDifficulty / 50, 1) * 0.2;
  const repoScore = Math.min(repoCount / 10, 1) * 0.05;
  const starScore = Math.min(starCount / 20, 1) * 0.05;

  return Math.round((commitScore + activityScore + problemScore + 
                    difficultyScore + repoScore + starScore) * 100);
};
```

### Activity Level Determination
```javascript
const getActivityLevel = (activeDays) => {
  if (activeDays >= 25) return "Very Active";
  if (activeDays >= 15) return "Active";
  if (activeDays >= 5) return "Moderate";
  return "Inactive";
};
```
